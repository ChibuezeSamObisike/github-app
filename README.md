### API integration

- Use axios

```js

// service
Used CSS to style the elements and appended Div in the end of each component name or main attached.

Also for styling some use like p-sm: for small tags and similar occurences.

Also used --light-theme for light Variant and also --dark-theme for dark variant in the index.css root file.
```

```js
For testing used Manual testing to make sure everything was well set out and properly working locally with alll effects set in place and working properly.
```
